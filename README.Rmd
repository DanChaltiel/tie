# tie

The goal is to `tie` return values from function to variables. 

This is more of an experiment, The [zeallot](https://github.com/nteetor/zeallot)
package is better. 

## Example

```{r example}
library(tie)

x <- rnorm(100)
tie[low,up] <- range(x)
low
up

tie[,q25,q50,q75,] <- quantile(x)
q25
q75

library(stringr)
fruits <- c(
  "apples and oranges and pears and bananas",
  "pineapples and mangos and guavas"
)
tie[left, right] <- str_split(fruits, " and ")
left
right

tie[coef, res] = lm( Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
coef
res
```
